# `www.worms.sh`

This is the source code repository for `www.worms.sh`. The site is under active
construction!

Tilde pages are not kept here since they are pulled from separate user
directories.

TODO:
- script out installation so only relevant files are installed into www/data
  directory (and thus accessible via http)
- unified CSS stylesheet
- add pages:
    - user pages
    - ideas + projects
        - make page open contribution (future: make it into a moodboard, forum,
          interactive, asynchronous thing)
        - some starter ideas: chatrooms (local, online); worms.sh colors
